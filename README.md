### Simple IP Tracker project made HTML, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript

## Demo
This project is live on [Netlify](https://eloquent-kepler-3bfcfb.netlify.app/)

## Used technologies
For the UI I used [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a CDN.
I am using [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) API for Ip tracking and GeoLocation.
[Leaflet]('https://leafletjs.com/') To generate the map.

```
NoTe: For the API the API_KEY is public. // *i know anyone can use it. its a free sub ;)
```
